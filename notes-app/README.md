## Development notes-app

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

### Set up Prisma

**There are two packages that we need to get started:**

+ prisma for interacting with our database and schema during development.
+ @prisma/client for making queries to our database during runtime.

```sh
npm install --save-dev prisma
npm install @prisma/client
```

**Now we can initialize Prisma with SQLite:**

```sh
npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
```

**With that in place, run this:**

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

```sh
npm run seed
```

*If you're having trouble, run npx prisma studio to see the database in the browser. It's possible you don't have any data because you forgot to run npx prisma db seed*

```sh
run npx prisma
```

### Auth

**After `npm run seed` you can login as username - kody & password - twixrox, but here you can create your own kitten or tiger ‚Äî you're already a master of registration and authorization at this stage! üò∫üêØ**

### Unexpected errors

I'm sorry, but there's no way to avoid errors at some point. Servers fall over, co-workers use // @ts-ignore, and so on. So let's just embrace the possibility of unexpected errors and deal with them. Or just grab a pillow and close your eyes ‚Äì that's an option too. üóø

*What I love about this is that in the case of the children routes, the only unusable part of the app is the part that actually broke. The rest of the app is completely interactive. There's another point for the user's experience!*
